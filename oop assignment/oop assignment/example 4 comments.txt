4. Declaring Variables

    string name;
    int age;
string name; → Declares a string variable name to store the user's name.
int age; → Declares an integer variable age to store the user's age.
These variables will be used to store user input.
5. Asking for User Input

    cout << "Enter your name: ";
cout (character output) is used to display text on the screen.
This prints "Enter your name: " so the user knows what to enter.

    cin >> name;
cin (character input) is used to take user input from the keyboard.
>> is the extraction operator, which takes input from the user and stores it in name.
Issue: cin only reads one word (it stops at a space). If a user enters "John Doe", only "John" will be stored in name.
6. Asking for the User's Age

    cout << "Enter your age: ";
Displays "Enter your age: " on the screen.

    cin >> age;
Takes user input for age and stores it as an integer.
7. Displaying the Output

    cout << "Hello, " << name << "! You are " << age << " years old." << endl;
cout prints a greeting message to the user.
<< is the insertion operator, which combines text and variable values.
name is printed inside "Hello, " << name << "!", displaying the user's name.
"You are " << age << " years old." prints the age.
endl moves the cursor to the next line.
