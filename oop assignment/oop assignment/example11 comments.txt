A while loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition remains true.
In this case, the loop will run as long as i is less than or equal to 5.
How a while Loop Works

while (condition) {
    // Code runs if condition is true
}
Before each loop execution, the condition is checked.
If the condition is true, the loop runs.
If the condition becomes false, the loop stops.
2. Declaring and Initializing i

int i = 1;
This creates an integer variable i and assigns it an initial value of 1.
This variable controls how many times the loop runs.
3. The Loop Body

    cout << "This is iteration " << i << endl;
This prints the current iteration number.
i is inserted into the output using <<.
4. Updating i

    i++;
After each loop execution, i++ increases i by 1.
This prevents the loop from running forever.
5. How the Loop Runs (Step by Step Execution)
Step	Current i Value	Condition (i <= 5)	Action	Next i Value (i++)
1st	1	true (1 ≤ 5)	Prints: "This is iteration 1"	2
2nd	2	true (2 ≤ 5)	Prints: "This is iteration 2"	3
3rd	3	true (3 ≤ 5)	Prints: "This is iteration 3"	4
4th	4	true (4 ≤ 5)	Prints: "This is iteration 4"	5
5th	5	true (5 ≤ 5)	Prints: "This is iteration 5"	6
6th	6	false (6 ≤ 5 is false)	Loop stops	—
6. Expected Output

This is iteration 1
This is iteration 2
This is iteration 3
This is iteration 4
This is iteration 5
