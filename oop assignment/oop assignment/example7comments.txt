

1. Declaring a Variable

int age = 16;
This declares an integer variable named age and assigns it the value 16.
This value will be used in a condition check.
2. The if Statement

if (age >= 18) {
The if statement checks whether the condition inside the parentheses (age >= 18) is true or false.
age >= 18 means:
If age is greater than or equal to 18, the condition is true.
If age is less than 18, the condition is false.
3. Executing Code Based on the Condition
Case 1: When age >= 18 (True)

    cout << "You are an adult." << endl;
If age is 18 or more, this line prints:

You are an adult.
The else block is skipped.
Case 2: When age < 18 (False)

} else {
    cout << "You are a minor." << endl;
}
If the if condition fails (age is less than 18), the else block executes.
It prints:

You are a minor.
4. Example Execution
Scenario 1: age = 20

if (20 >= 18)  // true
=> "You are an adult." is printed.
=> The else block is skipped.
Output:

You are an adult.
Scenario 2: age = 16

if (16 >= 18)  // false
=> The if block is skipped.
=> The else block runs.
Output:

You are a minor.
5. Expected Output (For age = 16)

You are a minor.
