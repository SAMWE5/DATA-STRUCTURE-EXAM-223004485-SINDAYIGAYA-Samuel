1. Understanding the for Loop

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
A for loop is used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

Parts of the for Loop

for (initialization; condition; update) {
Initialization (int i = 1;):

Creates an integer variable i and initializes it to 1.
This variable controls how many times the loop runs.
Condition (i <= 5;):

The loop continues as long as i is less than or equal to 5.
If i > 5, the loop stops.
Update (i++):

After each loop iteration, i increases by 1 (i = i + 1).
This ensures the loop progresses and eventually stops.
2. The Loop Body

    cout << "This is iteration " << i << endl;
This line prints the current iteration number.
i is inserted into the output using <<.
3. How the Loop Works (Step by Step Execution)
Iteration	i Value	Condition (i <= 5)	Output	i++ (Next Value)
1st	1	true	This is iteration 1	2
2nd	2	true	This is iteration 2	3
3rd	3	true	This is iteration 3	4
4th	4	true	This is iteration 4	5
5th	5	true	This is iteration 5	6
6th	6	false (Loop stops)	No output	â€”
4. Final Output

This is iteration 1
This is iteration 2
This is iteration 3
This is iteration 4
This is iteration 5
