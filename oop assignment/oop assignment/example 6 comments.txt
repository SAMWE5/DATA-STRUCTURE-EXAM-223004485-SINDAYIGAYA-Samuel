1. Declaring a Variable

int age = 18;
int age = 18; declares an integer variable named age and initializes it with the value 18.
This variable will be used in a condition check.
2. The if Statement

if (age >= 18) {
The if statement checks whether the condition inside the parentheses (age >= 18) is true or false.
age >= 18 means:
If age is greater than or equal to 18, the condition is true.
If age is less than 18, the condition is false.
How the Condition Works
If age = 18, then:

18 >= 18  → true
Since the condition is true, the code inside the { } block executes.
If age = 17, then:

17 >= 18  → false
Since the condition is false, the block is skipped.
3. Printing the Output

    cout << "You are an adult." << endl;
This line runs only if the condition is true.
It prints the message:

You are an adult.
endl moves the cursor to a new line.
4. Example Execution
Case 1: age = 18

if (18 >= 18)  // true
=> "You are an adult." is printed.
Case 2: age = 20

if (20 >= 18)  // true
=> "You are an adult." is printed.
Case 3: age = 16

if (16 >= 18)  // false
=> The condition fails, so nothing is printed.
5. Expected Output
If age = 18:


You are an adult.
