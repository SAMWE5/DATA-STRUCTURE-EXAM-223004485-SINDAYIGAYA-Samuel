1. Declaring a Variable

int age = 25;
This declares an integer variable named age and assigns it the value 25.
The program will use this value to determine if the person is a minor, an adult, or a senior citizen.
2. The if Condition

if (age >= 18 && age < 60) {
This checks two conditions using the && (logical AND) operator:
age >= 18 → True if age is 18 or more.
age < 60 → True if age is less than 60.
Both conditions must be true for this block to execute.
If age is between 18 and 59, the program prints:

You are an adult.
3. The else if Condition

} else if (age >= 60) {
This block runs only if the first if condition fails.
age >= 60 checks if the person is 60 or older.
If true, the program prints:

You are a senior citizen.
4. The else Condition

} else {
If both previous conditions fail, this else block runs.
This means age must be less than 18.
The program prints:

You are a minor.
5. Example Execution
Let's analyze different cases:

Case 1: age = 25

if (25 >= 18 && 25 < 60)  // true
=> "You are an adult." is printed.
=> The rest of the conditions are skipped.
Output:


You are an adult.
Case 2: age = 65

if (65 >= 18 && 65 < 60)  // false (because 65 is not < 60)
=> Skips the if block.

else if (65 >= 60)  // true
=> "You are a senior citizen." is printed.
Output:


You are a senior citizen.
Case 3: age = 15

if (15 >= 18 && 15 < 60)  // false
=> Skips the if block.

else if (15 >= 60)  // false
=> Skips the else if block.

else
=> "You are a minor." is printed.
Output:

You are a minor.
6. Expected Output for age = 25

You are an adult.
