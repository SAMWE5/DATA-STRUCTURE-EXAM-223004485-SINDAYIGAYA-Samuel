1. Variable Declarations

int a = 10, b = 3;
This declares two integer (int) variables:
a is assigned 10.
b is assigned 3.
These values will be used in arithmetic operations.
2. Performing Arithmetic Operations
Each cout statement prints the result of a mathematical operation.
Addition

cout << "Sum: " << a + b << endl;
a + b performs addition:

10 + 3 = 13
The output will be:


Sum: 13
Subtraction

cout << "Difference: " << a - b << endl;
a - b performs subtraction:

10 - 3 = 7
The output will be:


Difference: 7
Multiplication

cout << "Product: " << a * b << endl;
a * b performs multiplication:

10 * 3 = 30
The output will be:

Product: 30
Division (Integer Division)

cout << "Quotient: " << a / b << endl;
a / b performs integer division:

10 / 3 = 3
Since both a and b are integers, the decimal part is discarded.
C++ performs integer division when both operands are integers.
The output will be:

Quotient: 3
Modulus (Remainder)

cout << "Remainder: " << a % b << endl;
a % b calculates the remainder of the division:

10 % 3 = 1
10 / 3 gives a quotient of 3, and the remainder is 1.
The output will be:

Remainder: 1
